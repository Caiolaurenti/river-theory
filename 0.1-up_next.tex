	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let's compare, for a preorder $\Po$ and its corresponding partial order $\Po' = \Dom \Po/(\Po \cap \Po^{-1})$, the hydrospheres $V$ and $V'$;
		\item We will also investigate the conjecture we posed on "When i had a body";
		\item Exploration of the duals in the categories defined by noetic currents;
	\end{itemize}
	While we also keep in mind:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An analogy is a noetic current such that there exists a monotonic map $f: \Dom \Po \to \Dom \Po'$, for each polarity $[a \connect b]$, the "path" of its image starts in $f(a)$ and ends in $f(b)$. We will later study these objects;
		\item For now, we have been working with the case where $\Po$ is known. What would happen if we didn't have a map, but started with a finite number of polarities as information? When would we be able to "solve" relations using transitivity?
		\item We could also take the coagulant to be $S' = \{ x \connect y + y \connect x\}$, imposing a hierarchy in polarities (this gives me the chills). What would happen to the structure in this case?
		\item It also seems to me to be possible to define hydrospheres in a way that would not collapse to the space where all relations are possible, but I need to tweak the definitions in order to do so.
	\end{itemize}
