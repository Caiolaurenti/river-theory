\title{Noetic Currents}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	\par We define the following morphisms:
	\begin{definition}
		Let $\mathbb{P}, \mathbb{P}'$ be partial orders with hydrosphere $V$, $V'$, respectively. A linear transformation $T: V \to V'$ is called a \textit{speculation} when, for each polarity $a \leq b$ of the spanning forest of $V$, there exists a chain $c_1 \leq \cdots \leq c_n$, and coefficients $\alpha_i$, $i = 1, \dots, n_{[a \connect b]}$, such that 
		\[
			T([a \connect b]) = \sum_i \alpha_i [c_i \connect c_{i+1}]
		\] 
		If, furthermore, each $\alpha_i \neq 0$, then $T$ is called a \textit{canalization}.
		The extension of $\{\text{speculation}, \text{canalization}\}$ is called a \textit{noetic current}.
	\end{definition}

	Because of the additive transitiveness property, it is clear that each noetic current defines its own category.
