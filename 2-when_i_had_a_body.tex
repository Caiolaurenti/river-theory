	\par For this part, we will take $R = k$, where $k$ is a field.
	\begin{definition}
		 Now, for a preorder $\Po$, take the set $\{C_1, \dots, C_n\}$ of connected components of the hydrography of $V$, and consider the set $\mathcal{F} = \{T_1, \dots, T_n\}$, where each $T_i$ is a spanning tree of $C_i$ (a \textit{spanning tree} is a minimal tree that connects all the vertices).  We call the extension of $\mathcal{F}$ a \textit{spanning forest} of $\Po$.
	\end{definition}
	Now, we start with an axiom:
	\begin{mata}
		If $\mathbb{T}$ is a tree (a poset in which every initial segment is totally ordered), then $\mathcal{B} = \{[a \connect b]: a \leq b \text{ is an edge in } \mathbb{T}\}$ is linearly independent.
	\end{mata}

	\begin{cor}
		Let $\mathbb{P}$ be a connected partial order with $d$ vertices. Then $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $V$. Thus, $\dim V = d - 1$.
	\end{cor}
	\par We will briefly comment this result: this proves that given connected preorders $\Po$ and $\Po'$ with $d$ vertices, their hydrospheres are isomorphic. We may think that, for a connection $a \sim b$ of vertices not in the preorder, we may consider $r = \min S_a \cap S_b$ to be the maximum "ancestor" of both, and consider $"[a \sim b]" = [r \connect a] + [r \connect b]$. This shows that $V$ encodes all possible connections of vertices - when $\Po$ is connected, of course.
	\par Now, for a general preorder $\Po$, consider $V_i$ to be the subspace generated by the spanning tree $T_i$. We pose a conjecture:
	\begin{conj}
		For a preorder $\Po$ such as above, $V_i \cap V_j = 0$ if $i \neq j$.
	\end{conj}
	If the above conjecture did hold, we would have $V = \bigoplus_i V_i$.
