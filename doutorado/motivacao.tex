\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ be a ring, and $\Po$ be a preorder - we will refer to this preorder
    as a \textit{map}. 
    Consider the \textit{space of connections} $\mathbb{L} = \Po \cup \Po^{-1}$.
    If $(a, b) \in \mathbb{L}$, we denote $a \connect b$.
    Now, consider $\mathbb{V}$ to be the free $A$-module generated by $\mathbb{L}$.
    We calll it \textit{solution} of $\Po$.\\
    Now define the sets $S = \{ a \connect b - b \connect y\}_{a \leq b}$ and $T = \{ a \connect b + b \connect c - a \connect c\}_{a \leq b \leq c}$. These sets are called the \textit{coagulant} and \textit{solvent}, and its elements are called \textit{symmetries} and \textit{transitivities}, respectively. We define the \textit{congeal} (name and notation for the congeal are not yet stablished) as $\mathbb{V}_S = \mathbb{V} / \langle S \rangle$, where $\langle X \rangle$ is the submodule generated by $X$. The \textit{hydrosphere} is $V_\mathbb{P} = \mathbb{V}_S/\langle \pi(T') \rangle$, where $\pi$ is the projection $\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{V}_S$. If $a \connect b$, we write its image in $V_\mathbb{P}$ as $[a \connect b]$, and call it a \textit{polarity}.
\end{definition}
\par When it is
\begin{prop}
	Given a hydrosphere $V$, we have:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $a \connect b$, then $[a \connect b] = [b \connect a]$;
		\item If $a \leq b \leq c$, then $[a \connect b] + [b \connect c] = [a \connect c]$;
		\item When $a$ is an element of $\Dom \Po$, $[a \connect a] = 0$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	I will only prove that last one: since $a \leq a \leq a$, $[a \connect a] + [a \connect a] = [a \connect a]$. Thus, $[a \connect a] = 0$.
\end{proof}
\par A \textit{map} will be illustrated by its Hasse diagram, and we will see that this diagram will be an important part of our work. For clarity:
\begin{definition}
	Given a finite preorder $\Po$, its Hasse diagram (which we will call a \textit{hydrography}) is the graph when the vertices are the elements of $\Dom \Po$, and the edges are the pairs $a \leq b$, when there is no $c \notin \{a, b\}$ such that $a \leq c \leq b$.
\end{definition}
	If $a \leq b$ is an edge of the Hasse diagram of $\Po$, then $[a \connect b]$ is called an \textit{edge} of $V$.
\begin{prop}
	Let $\Po$ be a finite preorder. Then the edges generate the hydrosphere.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	It is clear that the polarities generate $V$. Let $[a \connect b]$ be a polarity that is not an edge. Then there exists a chain $a := c_1 \leq  \cdots \leq c_n =: b$, $n > 2$, where each $[c_i \connect c_{i+1}]$, $i = 1, \dots, n-1$, is an edge. Thus $[a \connect b] = \sum_i [c_i \connect c_{i+1}]$.
\end{proof}
